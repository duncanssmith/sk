 Mineral and Vitamin Deficiency 
</h1>
<p>
Mineral and vitamin deficiencies in the diet can have a wide range of effects.
</p>
<p> 
Vitamins are essential components of the diet, and deficiencies result in very specific diseases. Certain foods are rich in some vitamins, while others contain very low levels. For a dietician it is important to understand and identify the whole range of vitamin deficiency symptoms, and to also know the best dietary sources, in order to be able to make correct diagnoses and to recommend effective treatments.
</p>
<p>
Good nutrition is also essential in providing the minerals we all require for good health. As with vitamins, certain foods are rich in essential minerals, while others may have none. Identifying the symptoms of mineral deficiency is the route to diagnosis and treatment.
</p>
<p>
Mineral and vitamin supplements can help, but in most cases dietary changes can provide the required replenishment of these vital nutrients.
