<h1>
Vegetarian and Vegan Nutrition
</h1>
<p>
Vegetarian and vegan diets are healthy and nutritious and delicious, however as any vegetarian or vegan knows it is important to have an understanding of the particular types of foods that are essential in order to achieve a balanced diet. 
</p>
<p>
Non-vegetarians meet most of their protein needs through the consumption of meat or fish, whereas vegetarians and vegans must source their protein from good vegetable sources such as beans and peas and lentils (pulses) and grain-based foods such as bread.

Being vegetarian means different things to
different people. Some people include 'white'
meats, such as fish or chicken (semivegetarian).
Others avoid all meat but still enjoy
dairy products and eggs (lacto-ovo-vegetarian).
Vegans avoid using any animal product, from meat
and eggs to leather shoes. Whichever type of
vegetarian you are, you still need to make sure you
get all the nutrients your body needs. An easy way
to plan your diet is to think about the food groups.
Bread, other cereals and potatoes
This food group, especially
wholegrain products and fortified
breakfast cereals, contributes
essential nutrients such as iron and
zinc. These foods should form the
basis of every meal.
Focus on fruit and
vegetables
Aim for five servings of fruit and
vegetables each day. Those
containing vitamin C,
including citrus fruits, berries, melon,
tomatoes and peppers, increase the
absorption of iron from non-meat
foods, so are especially valuable if
you are vegetarian. Try and have a
glass of orange juice with your
breakfast cereal perhaps or peppers
in a stir-fry with brown rice.
Alternatives to meat
It is especially important if you are
vegetarian to get your protein, iron and zinc from
sources other than meat. Choose from the foods
listed below - in combination with grain foods,
these provide us with protein equivalent to that
from animal foods:
􀂄 Soya-based foods, including
tofu
􀂄 Beans, lentils and chickpeas
(dried or tinned)
􀂄 Seeds, nuts and nut butters,
like peanut butter (although these tend to be
high in fat)
􀂄 Eggs (if you eat them)
Don't forget dairy foods or their
alternatives
Be sure to include these foods several times a day
if you don't eat dairy foods as you need to keep
your calcium intake up:
􀂄 Calcium-fortified soya milk, puddings and
orange juice
􀂄 Tofu
􀂄 Brown or white bread
􀂄 Dried fruit, eg apricots
􀂄 Green leafy vegetables
(apart from spinach)
􀂄 Nuts and sesame seeds
􀂄 Tinned salmon & sardines
(if you eat fish)
Other concerns
If you rarely or never eat animal
foods you need to make sure you are
getting enough vitamin D, vitamin B2
and vitamin B12. Vitamin D is generated by
sunlight on our skin, but if you don't go outside
much or if you have dark skin, you should include
fortified margarine or spreads and fortified
breakfast cereals in your diet. You may also need
a supplement. For vitamin B2 and B12 try to have
fortified breakfast cereal, soya foods or yeast
extract regularly - otherwise consider a
supplement.
If you are a vegan you should also include small
amounts of iodised salt or seaweed.
It is also important to take extra care during
pregnancy, breastfeeding, weaning or in childhood
to make sure that all nutritional needs are
being met. Additional dietary advice
may be needed.
While there are many health
benefits to being a vegetarian,
remember, there is more to it than
just giving up meat. Any diet that is
not planned properly can mean that
you miss out on essential nutrients.
Following these guidelines will
ensure that you enjoy all the
health benefits as well as a
nutritious and complete
vegetarian diet.
