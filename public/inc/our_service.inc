<p>
Many of the choices we make may be less than optimal for our health; most of us know that too much fat, salt or alcohol, for example, can be harmful, but there are many foods that contain much more fat or salt or sugar than most people realise. There may be other foods that, together, or over the course of time, can constitute an unhealthy diet for us as individuals. Or it may be that beneficial foods are being omitted from your normal diet.
</p>

<p>
With food and health so often in the media spotlight, it can be a challenge to know what is best for you.
